Numerical Methods for computing root of a function.
===================================================

This file contains matlab code for computing the root of a function using the following three methods.

* Bisection Method
* False Position Method (Improved Bisection)
* Newton Rhapson Method
* Secant Method

Here is a description of the contents of this repository.

* src Folder
  - This folder contains the source code for the modules of the 4 methods mentioned above. It also contains a main program that demonstrates the comparison between various methods by computing the iterations the methods take to compute square roots of numbers ranging from 1 to 1000. 

* plots Folder
  - This folder contains plots for all 4 method (iterations as a function of number). As well as comparison plots for all 4 methods.

* report Folder
  - This folder contains a report outlining the conclusions and ifnerences drawn from the comparisons done in the main program.
